                <h3>Yala National Park</h3>
                <p>Yala National Park, situated in the southeastern part of Sri Lanka, is renowned for its rich
                    biodiversity and diverse ecosystems. As the country's most visited national park, Yala offers a
                    stunning landscape featuring grassy plains, dense jungles, and coastal lagoons. The park is a haven
                    for a variety of wildlife, making it a popular destination for safari enthusiasts and nature lovers.
                </p>
                <p>One of the park's most iconic residents is the Sri Lankan Leopard, a species known for its elusive
                    nature and striking beauty. Yala boasts a significant leopard population, providing visitors with a
                    unique opportunity to witness these majestic big cats in their natural habitat. The coexistence of
                    leopards with other wildlife species in Yala National Park creates a captivating and dynamic
                    ecosystem, making it a must-visit destination for those seeking an unforgettable wildlife experience
                    in Sri Lanka.</p>

            <div class="venue">
                <h3>Horton Plains</h3>
                <p>Horton Plains, a high-elevation plateau in Sri Lanka's central highlands, is renowned for its misty
                    rolling plains, diverse wildlife, and iconic landmarks like the "World's End View Point" and Bakers
                    Falls. Once part of the Maya Kingdom, it represents a historically significant landscape that has
                    undergone transformation due to colonial activities, resulting in a unique blend of natural beauty
                    and cultural heritage. Today, Horton Plains National Park stands as a popular tourist destination,
                    offering scenic landscapes and glimpses of the island's rich biodiversity.</p>
                <p> The Sri Lankan Leopard, a captivating and elusive predator, thrives in the grassy plains and dense
                    forests of Horton Plains. With a larger and broader facial structure than its lowland counterparts,
                    these leopards have adapted to the cold weather and abundant high-quality protein sources, primarily
                    in the form of Sambhur, the largest deer species in Sri Lanka. Despite their impressive size, these
                    leopards expertly navigate the tall grass, remaining concealed as they stalk prey or venture into
                    lower elevations seeking easy livestock. Horton Plains serves as a critical habitat for these
                    majestic big cats, adding to the park's allure for wildlife enthusiasts and conservationists alike.

                <h3>Kumana National Park</h3>

                    enthusiasts and nature lovers. Known for its diverse avian population, including migratory birds, it
                    features a range of ecosystems such as lagoons, scrublands, and mangrove swamps. The park's scenic
                    landscapes and vibrant birdlife make it a captivating destination for wildlife enthusiasts and

                    glimpse of these magnificent cats prowling through the park's wilderness. The coexistence of
                    leopards within the park adds to the overall biodiversity and contributes to Kumana's status as a
                    unique and varied natural reserve in Sri Lanka.</p>

                <h3>Wilpattu National Park</h3>
                <p>Wilpattu National Park, located on the northwest coast of Sri Lanka, is the country's largest
                    national park, renowned for its untamed wilderness and diverse ecosystems. Characterized by dense

                    population in Wilpattu adds to the park's allure, providing visitors with the opportunity to witness
                    these captivating creatures in their natural habitat. The park's diverse landscapes and the presence
                    of leopards contribute to Wilpattu's status as a vital conservation area and a captivating

                <h3>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h3>
                <p>Habitat loss and fragmentation pose dire consequences for leopard populations, leading to a decline
                    in available living space and increased human-wildlife conflict. This conflict often results in
                    retaliatory killings, stressing both leopards and affected communities and disrupting the ecological
                    balance of the ecosystem. To counter these threats, conservation efforts focus on establishing and
                    maintaining protected areas and wildlife corridors, reforesting degraded habitats, and implementing
                    sustainable land-use plans. These mechanisms aim to preserve leopard habitats, reduce fragmentation,
                    and foster coexistence between leopards and human activities, ensuring the long-term survival of
                    these magnificent predators and the biodiversity of their ecosystems.</p>

                <h3>Human-Wildlife Conflict</h3>
                <p>The escalating human-wildlife conflict, particularly with leopards, presents profound challenges.
                    Instances of leopards preying on livestock or entering human settlements often result in retaliatory
                    killings, disrupting both leopard populations and local communities. Continuous conflicts can
                    displace leopards from their natural habitats, altering their behavior and exacerbating
                    confrontations. Mitigation efforts involve community engagement, education, and preventive measures,
                    such as early warning systems and compensation programs. By fostering understanding and tolerance
                    among local communities and implementing proactive strategies, conservationists strive to minimize
                    human-leopard conflicts, ensuring the coexistence of these majestic predators with human
                    populations.</p>
