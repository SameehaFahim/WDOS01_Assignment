                <p>Wilpattu National Park, situated in a hot, semi-arid environment, experiences varying
                    temperatures throughout the year. The temperature ranges from approximately 26°C to about 30°C.
                    The North-east monsoon season, which occurs from September to December, is when Wilpattu
                    receives most of its rainfall.</p>
                <p>Despite its lush green appearance, especially during the monsoon season, Wilpattu's climate
                    reflects the characteristics of a hot and semi-arid region. Visitors to Wilpattu should be
                    prepared for warm temperatures, and the best time to explore the park is during the dry season
                    when water levels are lower, potentially increasing wildlife sightings.</p>
